# EtheriumDemoApp
Etherium demo app is an iOS App written in Swift to get Rinkeby account balance using private key and signing, verifying messages with private key. This is Universal app and supports both Portrait and landscape modes. I have used web3swift library to handle ethereum related tasks.

You can download the project and install the pods. Then you can run the project.
